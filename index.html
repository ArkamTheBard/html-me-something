                            <h2>Demon's Souls</h2>
                            <p>Demon's Souls (2009) was my introduction to what is referred to as Soulsborne games.
                                Up until then, most games I played felt too guiding, like they held the player's
                                hand along the way throughout the entire game. Demon's Souls was a completely different experience.
                                Really, a callback to when games really made the player think about how to tackle an unknown world.
                                The challenge and structure of the game that really asks the player to figure things out on their own
                                really drew me in to this game and I have loved games from the team at FromSoftware every since and with
                                the game now having a remastered release on the new PlayStation 5, I can fall in love with it all over again.

                                <h2>Dark Souls</h2>
                                <p>Dark Souls (2011) was FromSoftware's next big title following the success of Demon's Souls. At this stage, FromSoftware was still not the big name they are today.
                                    They were known for Armored Core and Demon's Souls, but were still not widely popular like they are now. Dark Souls would change that as it hit a bigger audience.
                                    Dark Souls released for not just the PS3, but also hit an audience on the Xbox 360 (and PC a little bit later). Much like Demon's Souls, the game consists of
                                    putting you in a world with very limited knowledge as to how it works. The challenge comes from huge boss enemies and unrelenting punishment for making mistakes.
                                    Death is a learning process in this game and while this frustrated many newcomers, it also retained a large amount of players because of this. Dark Souls became
                                    an icon in popular culture spawining many memes and jokes, but there was no arguing that Dark Souls' combat mechanics and feel were like no other at the time.
                                    Thus cementing FromSoftware's success as a game studio. Out of all of the Soulsborne games, I find that the first Dark Souls is my top favorite.

                            <h2>Dark Souls 2</h2>
                            <p>Dark Souls 2 (2014) was, most would say, an indirect sequel to Dark Souls 2011 or more commonly known as Dark Souls 1.</p>
