                            <h2>Demon's Souls</h2>
                            <p>Demon's Souls (2009) was my introduction to what is referred to as Soulsborne games.
                                Up until then, most games I played felt too guiding, like they held the player's
                                hand along the way throughout the entire game. Demon's Souls was a completely different experience.
                                Really, a callback to when games really made the player think about how to tackle an unknown world.
                                The challenge and structure of the game that really asks the player to figure things out on their own
                                really drew me in to this game and I have loved games from the team at FromSoftware every since and with
                                the game now having a remastered release on the new PlayStation 5, I can fall in love with it all over again.
                            </p>

                                <h2>Dark Souls</h2>
                                <p>Dark Souls (2011) was FromSoftware's next big title following the success of Demon's Souls. At this stage, FromSoftware was still not the big name they are today.
                                    They were known for Armored Core and Demon's Souls, but were still not widely popular like they are now. Dark Souls would change that as it hit a bigger audience.
                                    Dark Souls released for not just the PS3, but also hit an audience on the Xbox 360 (and PC a little bit later). Much like Demon's Souls, the game consists of
                                    putting you in a world with very limited knowledge as to how it works. The challenge comes from huge boss enemies and unrelenting punishment for making mistakes.
                                    Death is a learning process in this game and while this frustrated many newcomers, it also retained a large amount of players because of this. Dark Souls became
                                    an icon in popular culture spawining many memes and jokes, but there was no arguing that Dark Souls' combat mechanics and feel were like no other at the time.
                                    Thus cementing FromSoftware's success as a game studio. Out of all of the Soulsborne games, I find that the first Dark Souls is my top favorite.

                            <h2>Dark Souls 2</h2>
                            <p>Dark Souls 2 (2014) was, most would say, an indirect sequel to Dark Souls (2011) or more commonly known as Dark Souls 1. The overall feel and mechanics from Dark Souls 1
                                are more or less the same, but the lore of that world was expanded upon even more. The games typically follow this never ending cycle of fire and darkness and each game
                                takes place at the end of a cycle of fire, where the player makes a decision as rekindle the fire and have it burn a little longer or begin the age of darkness. However, due to
                                the constants extensions of the age of fire, a curse falls upon the world where its residents find themselves unable to fully die. Any death they experience brings them back, but
                                each time they being to lose a piece of their humanity until only an empty husk is left. These are the common enemies in the game known as hollows. In Dark Souls 2, however, what set it
                                apart is that the game hints that there is a way to break the curse, but that is up to the player to find out in a huge world full of traps, huge bosses, and plenty of dead ends. A true
                                adventure.

                            <h2>Dark Soul 3</h2>
                            <p>Dark Souls 3 (2016) felt more like a direct sequel to DS1 (Dark Souls 1). It takes place in a new kingdom different from DS2
                                and DS1, however very closely resembles (and makes refrences to) the kingdom of DS1. The architecture is of the buildings is
                                setup to create a sense of nostalgia from the first Dark Souls and many names will be familiar to long time fans. Even a few 
                                of the areas in DS3 are brought back from DS1, albeit with some changes as this world is still different. DS3 takes place at
                                a weird time in cycles. It is, once again, at the end of an age of fire, however, it implies no being similar to the player
                                from previous games (known as undead) have been able to rekindle the fire and continue the age of fire and no undead has been
                                able to rush in the age of darkness. The world is stale and the world is starting to crash together, as if the world itself
                                is rebelling against its residents and bringing them closer to one location so that someone can make things move again. DS3
                                really stood apart from the rest as a culmination to the overall story of Dark Souls as a franchise. A lot of changes to combat
                                and mechanics of the game were made that felt amazing. The lore of the world overall grew significantly in DS3, moreso than any
                                of the other games and I personally feel gave the franchise a great ending.
